Anemometry related functions (to be completed)
----------------------------
Set of functions which allows to obtain the True Airspeed (TAS), the
Equivalent airspeed (EAS) or the Calibrated Airspeed (CAS) known one of the
others.

True Airspeed (TAS): is the speed of the aircraft relative to the
airmass in which it is flying.

Equivalent Airspeed (EAS): is the airspeed at sea level in the
International Standard Atmosphere at which the dynamic pressure
is the same as the dynamic pressure at the true airspeed (TAS) and
altitude at which the aircraft is flying.

Calibrated airspeed (CAS) is the speed shown by a conventional
airspeed indicator after correction for instrument error and
position error.
